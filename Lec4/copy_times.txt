For loop cp:

real	0m22.962s
user	0m12.730s
sys	0m4.476s

while loop cp:

real	0m36.501s
user	0m29.411s
sys	0m4.023s

Binary loop cp:

real	0m25.977s
user	0m18.377s
sys	0m4.495s

Chunk loop cp:

real	0m7.956s
user	0m0.592s
sys	0m4.603s

UNIX cp:

real	0m6.689s
user	0m0.002s
sys	0m3.988s

These results were indicative of my testing, which means that the methods ranked from best to worst are:
1. UNIX cp
2. Block reading
3. Regular for loop
4. Binary reading
5. Regular while loop

This is very weird to me as I expected binary reading to be better than the regular for loop.
